# Contract: conventions for every work package

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Full gate (run before handing a WP to review, and it must pass) | `bun run verify` |
| Fast loop while working | `bun run typecheck`, `bun test <paths>`, `bun run lint`, `bun run format` (writes), `bun run grace:lint` |
| One package's tests | `bun test packages/kernel/test` (example) |

`bun run verify` = `check:bun && format:check && lint && typecheck && test && docs:build && test:e2e && grace:lint`, plus `&& telos:check` from WP15 on. Report each step's result exactly. Never claim a step passed that you did not run.

## Code

- TypeScript, strict, using the repository `tsconfig.base.json`. Imports have **no** `.ts` extension. Use `import type` for types only.
- Format: run `bun run format` and follow its output. The repository uses double quotes, semicolons and trailing commas.
- Effect 4.0.4 APIs only, as quoted in the contracts. If an API in a contract does not exist, stop and report it. Do not invent a replacement.
- No new dependency, no upgrade, no global install (C-002). Workspace links already exist from WP01.
- No placeholder code, no `TODO` stubs, no tests that assert nothing, no skipped tests.
- No compatibility aliases for removed names (C-004).
- Comments and messages are in English (C-009). Diagnostic and error messages are exactly as written in the contracts.
- Determinism (NFR-002): sort with plain code-unit comparison (`a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0`), never `localeCompare`. Never depend on object key insertion order from user input. Never use `Date.now()` or randomness in output except the `now` option of `verify`.

## Tests

- `bun:test` (`describe`, `test`, `expect`). Test files are `test/<module>.test.ts` next to the package's `src/`.
- Every diagnostic code, closure code and Archetype rule has at least one test where it is reported or fails, and one where it is not reported or passes (NFR-005). The test name names the code or rule id.
- Never hard-code counts of documents, files, Loci or findings that change as the repository grows. Assert membership, or compare with a value computed from the same source.
- No network and no credentials (NFR-007). Subprocess tests use `Bun.spawn(["bun", <absolute path>], ...)` with a 20 s test timeout.
- Fixtures are built in the test file or in `test/fixture.ts`. Never import another package's `test/` files.

## GRACE file markup

Every new `src/*.ts`, `bin/*.ts` and `scripts/*.ts` file starts with this header. Copy the shape from `scripts/review-gate.ts`:

```ts
// START_MODULE_CONTRACT
//   PURPOSE: <one sentence>
//   SCOPE: <what the file contains and what it never does>
//   DEPENDS: <module ids, comma-separated, or none>
//   LINKS: <M-ID>, <V-M-ID>
//   ROLE: RUNTIME
//   MAP_MODE: EXPORTS
// END_MODULE_CONTRACT
//
// START_MODULE_MAP
//   <exportName> - <short description>      (one line per export, every export, in file order)
// END_MODULE_MAP
```

Each exported function, constant or class has a contract block right above it:

```ts
// START_CONTRACT: <exportName>
//   PURPOSE: ...
//   INPUTS: { name: type - meaning, ... }
//   OUTPUTS: { type - meaning }
//   SIDE_EFFECTS: none | <what>
//   LINKS: <M-ID>
// END_CONTRACT: <exportName>
```

Exported types and interfaces need only the MODULE_MAP line. Test files use `ROLE: TEST` and `MAP_MODE: LOCALS`, and list their local helpers in the map. A test file with no local helpers has exactly one map line `(none) - no local helpers`, with the parentheses. Never write `none - no local helpers`: `grace lint` reads the leading identifier of each map line as a symbol name, so a bare `none` counts as a helper that does not exist and fails with `markup.module-map-mismatch`. `(none)` does not start with an identifier, so it keeps the map non-empty (no `markup.module-map-missing`) without naming a symbol. Optional named regions use `// START_BLOCK_<NAME>` / `// END_BLOCK_<NAME>`. The guides quote these regions (contracts/docs.md).

## GRACE graph and verification layout (created by WP01)

WP01 replaces `graph/main.xml` and `verification/main.xml` with one document per area:

- It moves the existing modules unchanged into `tooling`, `legacy` and `docs`.
- It creates the other documents empty with `<Owns />`.
- It rewrites both index files to list every document.

A WP edits **only** its own area documents and its own `<GD-…>` / `<VD-…>` block in `graph/index.xml` and `verification/index.xml`.

| Area | Graph doc / id | Verification doc / id | Owner WP | Modules (graph id → paths) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tooling | `graph/tooling.xml` `GD-TOOLING` | `verification/tooling.xml` `VD-TOOLING` | WP01 (move), WP15, WP20 | `M-BUN-VERSION-GUARD`, `M-REVIEW-GATE` (moved); WP15: `M-REPOSITORY-MODEL` → `telos.ts`, `M-TELOS-COMMAND` → `scripts/telos.ts` |
| legacy | `graph/legacy.xml` `GD-LEGACY` | `verification/legacy.xml` `VD-LEGACY` | WP01 (move), WP20 (delete) | the six `M-LOCUS-*` modules (moved) |
| docs | `graph/docs.xml` `GD-DOCS` | `verification/docs.xml` `VD-DOCS` | WP01 (move), WP18, WP19, WP20 | `M-DOCS-CONTENT`, `M-DOCS-SPEC-REPORT`, `M-DOCS-SITE`, `M-DOCS-PLAYGROUND` (moved); WP18: rewrite `M-DOCS-PLAYGROUND`; WP19: `M-DOCS-SPEC-REPORT` → `M-DOCS-SEMANTIC-REPORT`, add `M-DOCS-INSPECTOR`; WP20: add `M-DOCS-CALCULATOR` |
| kernel-base | `graph/kernel-base.xml` `GD-KERNEL-BASE` | `verification/kernel-base.xml` `VD-KERNEL-BASE` | WP02 | `M-KERNEL-IDENTITY` → identity.ts, freeze.ts; `M-KERNEL-CANONICAL` → canonical.ts, digest.ts; `M-KERNEL-DIAGNOSTIC` → diagnostic.ts, cycles.ts |
| kernel-definitions | `GD-KERNEL-DEFINITIONS` | `VD-KERNEL-DEFINITIONS` | WP03 | `M-KERNEL-DEFINITIONS` → relation.ts, capability.ts, extension.ts, archetype.ts, locus.ts, extensions/purpose.ts, extensions/source.ts |
| kernel-model | `GD-KERNEL-MODEL` | `VD-KERNEL-MODEL` | WP04 (WP22: adds a path and test files) | `M-KERNEL-MODEL` → model.ts; WP22 adds readonly-map.ts |
| kernel-verify | `GD-KERNEL-VERIFY` | `VD-KERNEL-VERIFY` | WP05 | `M-KERNEL-VERIFY` → verify.ts |
| kernel-describe | `GD-KERNEL-DESCRIBE` | `VD-KERNEL-DESCRIBE` | WP06 | `M-KERNEL-DESCRIBE` → describe.ts, fields.ts; `M-KERNEL-INVOKE` → invoke.ts |
| kernel-decode | `GD-KERNEL-DECODE` | `VD-KERNEL-DECODE` | WP07 | `M-KERNEL-DECODE` → decode.ts |
| kernel-closure | `GD-KERNEL-CLOSURE` | `VD-KERNEL-CLOSURE` | WP08 (WP22: adds a test file) | `M-KERNEL-CLOSURE` → closure.ts |
| kernel-api | `GD-KERNEL-API` | `VD-KERNEL-API` | WP09 | `M-KERNEL-INTROSPECTION` → introspection.ts; `M-KERNEL-IMPACT` → impact.ts; `M-KERNEL-API` → index.ts |
| pack-cli | `GD-PACK-CLI` | `VD-PACK-CLI` | WP10 | `M-PACK-CLI` → all `packages/cli/src/*.ts` |
| pack-agent | `GD-PACK-AGENT` | `VD-PACK-AGENT` | WP11 | `M-PACK-AGENT` → semantics, archetype, tools, introspection-tools, index; `M-PACK-AGENT-MCP` → mcp.ts, client.ts |
| pack-web | `GD-PACK-WEB` | `VD-PACK-WEB` | WP12 | `M-PACK-WEB` → all `packages/web/src/*.ts` |
| calculator-core | `GD-CALCULATOR-CORE` | `VD-CALCULATOR-CORE` | WP13 | `M-CALC-ARITHMETIC` → errors.ts, arithmetic.ts, archetypes.ts (index.ts until WP14 takes it) |
| calculator-interfaces | `GD-CALCULATOR-INTERFACES` | `VD-CALCULATOR-INTERFACES` | WP14 | `M-CALC-INTERFACES` → interfaces.ts, app.ts, index.ts, bin/cli.ts, bin/mcp.ts, bin/agent-demo.ts |

The file name of a graph or verification document is the area name, e.g. `graph/kernel-model.xml`. Kernel paths are under `packages/kernel/src/`, and calculator paths under `apps/calculator/`.

### Graph entry

Each module lists its dependency modules as empty child elements, as in the existing documents:

```xml
<M-KERNEL-MODEL>
  <Summary>Builds a checked semantic model from a root Locus and reports structural diagnostics.</Summary>
  <Path>packages/kernel/src/model.ts</Path>
  <M-KERNEL-DEFINITIONS />
  <M-KERNEL-DIAGNOSTIC />
</M-KERNEL-MODEL>
```

### Verification entry

```xml
<V-M-KERNEL-MODEL>
  <TestFiles>
    <File>packages/kernel/test/model.test.ts</File>
  </TestFiles>
  <Command>bun test packages/kernel/test/model.test.ts</Command>
  <Scenario>One sentence per tested behaviour.</Scenario>
  <TraceAssertion>Names the tests that prove the scenarios.</TraceAssertion>
</V-M-KERNEL-MODEL>
```

Register a module **only together with** its verification entry, and only once the listed test files exist. Otherwise `grace lint` reports `missing-module-coverage` or `invalid-test-file` (research R8). Add the ids to your `<Owns>` blocks in both index files.

## Git

- Spec Kitty creates your worktree and branch. Commit only inside it.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0: `feat(kernel): build the semantic model`, `docs(foundation): ...`, `test(cli): ...`.
- No AI names, and no author, co-author or session lines. The `.githooks/commit-msg` hook enforces this. Never use `--no-verify`.
- Never edit files that another WP owns (see each WP's "Owned files"). If a needed change falls outside your files, stop and report it.
